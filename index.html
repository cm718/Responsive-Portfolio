 <!-- I built my nav and copied and pasted it into all three html documents so that it would be uniform across each page. Each nav and div are given the display: flex; rule so that I could manipulate the divs using flexbox rules. The nav holds the menu-container so that the whole menu-container (think navbar) could be centered more easily within the larger nav box. I continue this logic throughout. -->

      <p>My name is Chris and I am a Christian, husband, father, and pastor. I also work full time for Apple. I am now adding developer to the list. I decided to start learning to code a few months back at the recommendation of a friend from work. He had just begun this program and suggested I check out some online courses to see what I thought of it. </p>
      <p>I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I really enjoyed the challenge and sense of success when things worked. As the months went by I found myself really loving the learning process. My wife and I began to discuss the possibility of a career change. I was learning more about web development as well as the wonderful job market that exists for developers.</p>
      <!-- Needed to give the third p an id to select it specifically so that I could give it some extra margin at the bottom -->
      <p id='p2'>I decided that when the next boot camp opened up I would apply and here I am today. I look forward to refining what I already know as well as building on my current skills, specifically with Javascript and back end development.</p>
